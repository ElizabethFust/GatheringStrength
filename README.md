# Elizabeth Fust's Code Louisville Front End Development Project, March 2019
## Gathering Strength, Inc.

This website is a final project for the Code Louisville Front End Web Development class (Jan - Mar 2019).  It is designed for Gathering Strength, Inc., which is a new nonprofit corporation in Louisville, Kentucky with the mission of empowering people with physically disabling conditions to maintain and improve their health and wellness by ensuring access to therapeutic physical activity.  

The project includes a Landing page, a Testimonials page, and a Contact page.  On the Testimonials page are embeded Youtube videos, which are responsive and change size as the viewport becomes smaller.  The Contact page includes two forms, one through which a user can request alerts from the organization, and one through which the user can contact the organization.

## Project Requirements

####**Responsive Design**

The project incorporates responsive design in two ways:  it uses Bootstrap's responsive classes, and it uses media queries to change elements on the page for different viewport sizes.

####**Custom CSS**

The project includes custom CSS in a file entitled css/style.css.  The CSS file  includes code that creates user interactivity.  On the Contact page:  when a user hovers over an input block on the form, it changes color.  Also, when a category on the form is chosen, the category becomes bold.

####**Custom-written JavaScript**

The project includes custom-written JavaScript on the Contact page.  On the Contact page there is a section in which a user can enter personal information and click a button to receive alerts from the organization.  When the "alerts" button is clicked the section slides out of view.  If the button is clicked again, the form reveals itself.

In addition, the Contact page includes a "contact us" section where a user can enter his/her name, email address, and a message.  If one of the inputs is left blank, an alert appears and requests the user to provide the information, e.g., "Please enter your first name."  Once all of the required information is entered and the submit button is clicked, an alert appears thanking the person, using the first name s/he entered on the form.
